# Sample page to test Dark Mode Toggling

  This single page website is created to test how well can I handle dark mode toggling. Nowadays everyone loves dark mode and I don't want to be the kind of guy to burn their eyes with bright backgrounds.

## Adjusting the color and brightness.

 Colors here are css variables. They can be easily changed globally.
